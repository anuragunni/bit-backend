- current topic progress (number of modules completed/not completed if not done already)
- current activity in current topic - bryan z

NOTES by bryan z: 

- Tracks are less relevant now with a focus on topics
- Students can work on one topic at a time but can archive topics they don't want to work on anymore and switch into new ones which will be considered 'current'
- the progress bar will literally be number of modules completed so I can calculate that on my own
