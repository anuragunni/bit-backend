# Benefits of switching from a Code-First to API-First Design

During our first attempt of building our Learning Management System(LMS), we decided to use a Code-First approach. At first, building out the system was quite simple, but as our team started to build more complex features, we started ending up with a lot of repeated code. After much debate, we decided that it would be better to restart the project and go with an API-First-Design approach. This was the best decision we made and I will explain why.
