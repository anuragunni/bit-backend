# React Curriculum

Emphasis on Button used as a *playground* for testing and fun

## Week 1: Intro to HTML/CSS

---

This may end up being a crash course and students just need a general idea of available elements or tools in the toolbox. There will be example practice opportunities but it may not be a lot. Kinda a *"here, this exists"* thing, but they'll get a lot more practice next week.

### HTML (2 days)

- Learn the HTML tree
- What elements are available
    - lists, header, paragraph
    - links, images
    - forms
    - Generic block and inline elements: `div`, `span`
- id, classes, style

### CSS (rest of the days)

- CSS common properties
    - `display`, `color`, `background-color`, `width`, `height`, `text-align`
- CSS Box Model
    - `margin`, `padding`, `border`
- CSS `class`, `id` selectors and specificity
- Crash course of advanced properties
    - this can literally be like: "*here this exists, we'll cover later but learn if you want"*
    - `position`, `units`, `transform`, `transition`, `flexbox`

### Project: Build a Static Button

- Will be building a super basic button, along with small exercises as buildup

## Week 2: JavaScript + more CSS (practice)

---

This week will be a focus on practicing their CSS skills through exercises. JavaScript and ES6 function syntax. NOTICE: Do not actually teach students many functions in VanillaJs. Teach students how JavaScript enhances the browsing experience for the user.

### CSS

- CSS Exercises
- Advanced CSS features in-depth

### JavaScript (More than half the days)

- Why JavaScript is necessary
- HTML DOM
- Teach old syntax but emphasize ES6 (because ES6 syntax is used significantly in React)
- JavaScript Events
- JavaScript functions and variables
- JavaScript Objects, Arrays

### Project: Build a Purposeful Button

- button that changes on click or does something

## Week 3: Components and Props

---

Although students will be switching to an entirely new system, the core concepts are the same. Make this the least scary as possible: make installation steps simple and as smooth as possible. Students will literally still be using "HTML" `jsx` and CSS for stuff, Javascript

### Transition into React/Gatsby

- gatsby-starter-default, what it is
- What a react component is and how it blends HTML and CSS
- Transition into StyledComponents
- Props and how it can change a properties
- Learn more CSS and advanced CSS
- Teach file structure and organization, **good practice** coding

### Project: Build a Dynamic Button

- Buttons can be assigned different colors, text, and shapes by assigning diff props

## Week 4: States and Animations

---

Students will learn animations and states, but will have a lot more time to experiment with their newfound knowledge. practice is best

- learn animations
- learn component lifecycle, hooks or regular
- learn states

### Project: Build a Crazy Button

- Make animations states for the button that change upon click
