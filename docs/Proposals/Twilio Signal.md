# Twilio Signal

- Show the power of Twilio APIs to simplify the development process for students with little prior experience
- The importance of accessible software in hardware and engineering education
- Hopefully inspiring some software engineers to tinker with Twilio's APIs to build fun exciting projects!

Bit Project is a 100% student-run organization at UC Davis that work with underserved high school and college students. One of the most popular tracks offered by Bit Project is IoT(Internet of Things), where students design hardware to solve real-world problems. 

When conducting focus groups for this program, some students struggled to keep interest in the basic circuits curriculum we had developed. In an attempt to recapture their attention, one of our developers swooped in a few lines of code in their IDE to use the Twilio API to send a text to the student's phone. This sparked their interest

During the presentation, I would showcase some of the hardware projects done by the students that features the Twilio SMS API as well as the Video API. One student built a motion triggered camera to capture pictures of animal activity near Lake Tahoe, while another student built a air quality sensor to alert residents in areas affected by wildfires when an unhealthy particle count was detected.
