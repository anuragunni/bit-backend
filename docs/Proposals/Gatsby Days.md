# Gatsby Days

**Presentation Title : Teaching Web Development to Beginners with Gatsby.js**

**Abstract:** 

Bit Project is a student-led organization at UC Davis that works with advocates from the industry to develop software engineering coursework. One of the most popular tracks offered by Bit Project is Web Development, which allows students the opportunity to program a web application for a 501(c) nonprofit using React. 

However, students struggled with the unique project structure of Create-React-App when first learning React, as features outside of those for single-page applications (SPAs) were reliant on third-party tools and complex configurations. Thus, Gatsby is the perfect framework for beginner developers, as they can follow an intuitive structure consisting of internally linked pages created from individual components. Students preferred Gatsby over other frameworks because of its speed, instant feedback with Hot Reloading, and its integration with Netlify and Github. 

Within the span of six weeks, four student teams were able to build multi-page, multi-functional websites for STEM retention, LGBTQIA+ employment, veteran support, and an Indigenous interpreter training program. 

Our first cohort of students completed their web applications for the nonprofits successfully. We are planning on expanding our offerings with advanced coursework integrating GraphCMS and Contentful to Gatsby websites. 

Three main takeaways from the presentation: 

- Gatsby reduces the time spent on debugging configuration and routing errors and allows more focused instruction on core React.js and GraphQL functions.
- The Gatsby → Github → Netlify workflow allows students to rapidly prototype and visualize their work, which leads to higher retention and engagement rates.
- Completing hands-on projects for nonprofits not only teaches students web development, but also stresses the importance of coding for the good of society.

**Any additional notes or information you'd like to share?**

My name is Daniel Kim and I am a senior computer engineering student at UC Davis leading Bit Project. I have not given a technical talk before, but I would love to share my experience with Gatsby and the crucial role it plays in our student organization at Gatsby Days LA.
